            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my website! I computer science major / math minor at Oregon State University. 
            </p>
            <h3>Oregon State Rowing</h3>
            <p>
                I walked onto the club rowing team at Southern Oregon University where I first attended college. I had no experience rowing before but fell in love with the sport immediately. A coach at OSU heard about my quick progression in the sport and reached out to me. I jumped at the opportunity to particapte in a division 1 sport, something I would have never imagined doing before.
            </p>
            <p>
                It has been a blast being a part of such a highly competitive and focused team. Every day I get to surround myself with my best friends as we push eachother to break through physical and mental barriers. I was elected team captain my junior year and rowed 6 seat in the varsity boat in a 14th place finish at the national championships(best we have done in over 10 years). I was also awarded the Impact award, an award which is given to the most impactful rower every year.
            </p>  
            <p>
                I have been reelected as captain my senior year. This year we have the potential to place higher than we ever have before. Our current class of rowers are incredibly focused and determined and I am extremely excited to see what legacy this team can leave behind.

            <h3>Ski Bum at Heart</h3>
            <p>
                I love skiing, biking, climbing, and anything outdoors. I grew up skiing on my local mountain in Southern Oregon every weekend, and moved to Lake Tahoe when I graduated high-school. After a year of ski bumming I returned to college and have been to busy with school to thuroughly enjoy the outdoors like I used to. I am looking forward to returning to my mountain adventures when I graduate and have a little more free time!

            <h3 id="padtop">What Now?</h3>
            <p>
                I have temporarily set aside my passion for getting rad to focus on my personal and educational development. I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science with a focus in artificial intelligence. I am specifically interested in machine learning, and graph neural networks. I am involved the <a href="https://simonensemble.github.io/">Simon Ensemble </a>, a research group at OSU applying machine and deep learning techniques to the prediction and analyzation of nano-porous materials used in applications such as gas storage, separation and sensing.
